description: "<p>I finally left Sutter Health after I had been there for 13 years in the early 1990s. I had met a CEO of the Decision Support Group (DSG) software company that was developing a new Data Analytics system for heatlhcare. I ended up migrating down to southern California as one of their developers, and was very excited because I could use the language Smalltalk to depoloy to our customers. We were one of the first companies that ever developed a data visualization system that would provide an interactive system in the Apple Macintosh, and Microsoft Windows enviornment. </p>"
