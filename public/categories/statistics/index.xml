      <description>Overview The Central Limit Theorem states that when samples of a population are large, the sampliing distribution will take the shape of a normal distribution regardless of the shape of the population from which the sample was drawn. This is proven out through the simulation below that projects the theoretical mean of the exponential distribution compared to the sampling. The variance between the theorectical mean, and the sample mean is .</description>
